# 🔍 Python Port Scanner (Dataset-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Python-based port scanning tool** designed to identify open ports and exposed services on a target system.  
The scanner uses a **CSV dataset** of commonly used ports and applies **socket programming and multithreading** to efficiently analyze network security risks.

⚠️ This tool is intended **only for educational purposes** and must be used on systems you own or have permission to test.
